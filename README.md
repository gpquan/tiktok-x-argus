This is WIP reverse engineering the Tiktok app HTTP headers. I was able to everse engineer many of the protobuf fields used in X-Gorgon, while some I used an emulator to calculate.
This was an exercise for me to get back into reverse engineering after many years I haven't practiced it. Discontinued my research as I needed tooling I didn't have to finish the few fields I haven't cracked.
